# BridgeDefense
This is another repo for another game I wanted to tinker with.

In this demo, you need to protect your beloved bridge from the disaster of purple enemies destroying it. (There are no animations yet, but trust me something is happening).

The player will have the ability to dash and attack, and the enemies will also attack you.

Use WASD for movement, space to dash, and c, end, or right click to attack.

If you happen to get pushed into a wall, you still can spam attack to kill them before they end your game.
